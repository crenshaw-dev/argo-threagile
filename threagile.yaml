# For a perfect editing experience within your IDE of choice you can easily
# get model syntax validation and autocompletion (very handy for enum values)
# as well as live templates: Just import the schema.json into your IDE and assign
# it as "schema" to each Threagile YAML file. Also try to import individual parts
# from the live-templates.txt file into your IDE as live editing templates.

# You might also want to try the REST API when running in server mode...

abuse_cases:
  Denial-of-Service: >
    As an attacker, I want to disturb the functionality of the backend system in order to cause indirect reputational damage via unusable features.
  CPU Cycle Theft / Deploying Crypto-Miner: >
    As an attacker, I want to compromise an Argo CD instance, in order to deploy a crypto-miner, to seek financial gains through stealing resources.
  Ransomware: >
    As a attacker I want to encrypt the storage and file systems in order to demand ransom.
  Identity Theft: >
    As a attacker I want to steal identity data in order to reuse credentials and/or keys on other targets of the same company or outside.
  PII Theft: >
    As a attacker I want to steal PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data in order to blackmail the company and/or damage
    their repudiation by publishing them.
  Database Compromise: >
    As a attacker I want to access the database backend of the SQL or Redis Database in order to steal/modify sensitive
    business data.
  Cross-Site Scripting Attacks: >
    As a attacker I want to execute Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and similar attacks in order to takeover victim sessions and
    cause reputational damage.
  # Argo specific
  Denial-of-Service of Argo CD Functionality: >
    As a attacker I want to disturb the functionality of Argo CD application areas in order to cause reputational and direct damage.
  Denial-of-Service of Argo CD User Functionality: >
    As a attacker I want to disturb the functionality of Argo CD user application areas in order to cause reputational and direct damage.
  Supply Chain Compromise:
    As a attacker I want to inflitrate the codebase of Argo CD so that I can introduce threats to the Argo project,
    and potentially projects using Argo CD causing both tangiable and reputational damage.
  Secrets System Compromise:
    As a attacker I want to find out Argo CD user secrets by attacking an Argo CD user's secrets manager
  Code Repository Compromise:
    As a attacker I want to infiltrate the codebase of an Argo CD user to affect their continuous delivery.
  Kubernetes Pod Container Compromise:
    As a attacker I want to compromise the integrity of a Kubernetes Container in order to conduct an attack.
  Kubernetes Pod Shared Storage Compromise:
    As a attacker I want to compromise the integrity of Kubernetes pod shared storage in order to conduct an attack.
  Kubernetes Pod Network Resources Compromise:
    As a attacker I want to compromise the integrity of a Kubernetes pod network resources in order to conduct an attack.
  Kubernetes Pod Init Container Compromise:
    As a attacker I want to compromise the integrity of a Kubernetes init container in order to conduct an attack.
  Kubernetes Node Compromise:
    As a attacker I want to compromise the integrity of a Kubernetes init container in order to conduct an attack.
  Kubernetes Cluster Compromise:
    As a attacker I want to compromise the integrity of a Kubernetes init container in order to conduct an attack.
  Argo CD Server Compromise:
    As a attacker I want to compromise the integrity of an Argo CD server in order to find information on users to perform attacks
  Poor validation:
    As a attacker I want to find areas in the system where validation is performed poorly so that I can attack systems.
  Malicious-In-The-Middle Attack:
    As a attacker I want to compromise Argo CD events, Argo CD rollouts and potentional connections between servers to enumerate as attack on a system



security_requirements:
  Users are restricted by RBAC: >
    RBAC rules defined by an Argo CD operator are actually enforced for API access.
  Input Validation: >
    Strict input validation is required to reduce the overall attack surface.
  Encryption During Transit: >
    Data must be transported through parts of the system encrypted to prevent Malicious-In-The-Middle Attack.
  Encryption at Rest: >
    If sensitive data is stored within the Argo CD system, then this must be encrypted to prevent an attacker retrieving this data during breach.

      any secrets. Integrity is important to ensure the correct manifests are deployed. The cache helps mitigate denial-of-service

# NOTE:
# For risk tracking each risk-id needs to be defined (the string with the @ sign in it). These unique risk IDs
# are visible in the PDF report (the small grey string under each risk), the Excel (column "ID"), as well as the JSON responses.
# Some risk IDs have only one @ sign in them, while others multiple. The idea is to allow for unique but still speaking IDs.
# Therefore each risk instance creates its individual ID by taking all affected elements causing the risk to be within an @-delimited part.
# Using wildcards (the * sign) for parts delimited by @ signs allows to handle groups of certain risks at once. Best is to lookup the IDs
# to use in the created Excel file. Alternatively a model macro "seed-risk-tracking" is available that helps in initially
# seeding the risk tracking part here based on already identified and not yet handled risks.
#risk_tracking:
#
#  unencrypted-asset@some-component: # wildcards "*" between the @ characters are possible
#    status: accepted # values: unchecked, in-discussion, accepted, in-progress, mitigated, false-positive
#    justification: Risk accepted as tolerable
